Resume Website - Notes

What's added:
- Resume action buttons: Open PDF, Download PDF, Print.
- Embedded PDF viewer (iframe) that loads `assets/amaan_resume.pdf` when available.
- "Copy email" button in Bio Data to copy the email to clipboard.
- Projects section with example project cards.

How to make the PDF viewer work locally:
1. Place your resume PDF in the `assets/` folder and name it `amaan_resume.pdf`.
   Example path (Windows):
   `c:\Users\Amaan Siddiqui\OneDrive\New folder\Desktop\College Material\Resume-Website-Project\assets\amaan_resume.pdf`
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or serve with a local server).
3. Click "Open PDF" to view the embedded resume; click "Download PDF" to download it.

Notes & next steps:
- If you want me to extract exact sections (experience, education, dates) from your PDF and populate the page text, allow me to access the PDF file or paste its text here and I will update the content accordingly.
- I can also add a printable HTML resume view that formats cleanly for PDF export.

If you'd like, I can:
- Replace the placeholder experience/education entries with the exact content from your resume.
- Add links to real project repositories.
- Add a polished printable resume HTML template and a "Save as PDF" button.

Tell me which of the above you'd like next.
